# NodeMCU-Dual-Pulse-Weld-Timer
Code for NodeMCU based double-pulse battery tab welder

This is the code to go along with the video about the project at https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=5kWRZHLDFLo

This code is most horrendous
I don't know LUA and I was too lazy to find out

Features include:
* Using individual files for each config value because I couldn't get delimiters or string splitting working
* Heavy misuse of if statements because I couldn't be bothered to work out how to use arrays.
* Untested timing cycles which may be out by many milliseconds
* Does actually work correctly though.
